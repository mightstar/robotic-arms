# Package Sorter Application

## Overview
The Package Sorter Application is a web-based tool designed for Thoughtfulâ€™s robotic automation factory. It allows users to input package dimensions and mass, then determines the correct stack (STANDARD, SPECIAL, REJECTED, or INVALID) for dispatch based on predefined criteria.

## Features
- **User Input for Package Specifications**: Users can input width, height, length (in centimeters), and mass (in kilograms) for a package.
- **Automatic Sorting Logic**: Based on the input, the application categorizes packages into STANDARD, SPECIAL, REJECTED, or INVALID.
- **Immediate Feedback**: The sorting result is displayed instantly on the webpage without needing to reload.

## How to Use
1. **Open the Application**: Load the HTML file in a web browser.
2. **Enter Package Details**: Input the width, height, length, and mass of the package in the respective fields.
3. **Submit**: Click the "Sort Package" button to see the sorting result.
4. **View Result**: The application will display the category of the package below the form.

## Manual Testing Guide
To ensure the application works as expected, you can perform manual tests using the following scenarios:

### Test Cases
1. **Standard Package**
   - **Input**: Width = 50 cm, Height = 50 cm, Length = 50 cm, Mass = 10 kg
   - **Expected Output**: Package Stack: STANDARD

2. **Special Package (Bulky by Volume)**
   - **Input**: Width = 100 cm, Height = 100 cm, Length = 100 cm, Mass = 10 kg
   - **Expected Output**: Package Stack: SPECIAL

3. **Special Package (Bulky by Dimension)**
   - **Input**: Width = 150 cm, Height = 50 cm, Length = 50 cm, Mass = 10 kg
   - **Expected Output**: Package Stack: SPECIAL

4. **Special Package (Heavy)**
   - **Input**: Width = 50 cm, Height = 50 cm, Length = 50 cm, Mass = 20 kg
   - **Expected Output**: Package Stack: SPECIAL

5. **Rejected Package (Bulky and Heavy)**
   - **Input**: Width = 150 cm, Height = 150 cm, Length = 150 cm, Mass = 20 kg
   - **Expected Output**: Package Stack: REJECTED

6. **Invalid Input (Negative Dimension)**
   - **Input**: Width = -50 cm, Height = 50 cm, Length = 50 cm, Mass = 10 kg
   - **Expected Output**: Package Stack: INVALID

### Tips for Testing
- Ensure to clear the input fields before entering new values for each test.
- Pay attention to the application's response to invalid inputs, such as negative numbers or non-numeric values.
